As with all new high technology, while the West concerns itself with the “how,” the question of “for whom” is put aside once again.Economists are only now realizing the full extent to which the communications revolution has affected the world economy. Information technology allows the extension of trade across geographical and industrial boundaries, and transitional corporations take full advantage of it.
